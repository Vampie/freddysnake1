# A Simple [Battlesnake](http://play.battlesnake.com) Written in Python

This is a basic implementation of the [Battlesnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api). It's a great starting point for anyone wanting to program their first Battlesnake using Python. It comes ready to use with [Repl.it](https://repl.it) and provides instructions below for getting started. It can also be deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com), or any other cloud provider you'd like.

And I'm testing things out. :)
